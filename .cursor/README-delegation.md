# Multi-Agent Task Delegation System

## Overview

This system enables automatic delegation of tasks to the most appropriate agent based on the task's requirements and agent capabilities. It integrates with the task management system to ensure that when tasks are started, they are automatically assigned to the best-suited agent.

## Key Components

### 1. Agent Delegation System

The agent delegation system is implemented in `.cursor/ensure-delegation.js` and provides:

- **Agent Switching**: Allows switching between different specialized agents
- **Task-Agent Matching**: Finds the best agent for a task based on its requirements
- **Capability-Based Matching**: Matches task requirements with agent capabilities

### 2. Task Management System

The task management system in `.cursor/agents/executive-architect/task-manager.js` provides:

- **Task Creation & Management**: Create, update, and manage tasks
- **Capability Extraction**: Extract required capabilities from task details
- **Agent Assignment**: Assign tasks to specialized agents

### 3. Task Command Handler

The task command handler in `.cursor/agents/executive-architect/task-command-handler.js` provides:

- **Command Processing**: Process task-related commands (list, start, complete, etc.)
- **Automatic Assignment**: Automatically assign tasks when they are started
- **Agent Switching**: Switch to the appropriate agent when a task is assigned

## How It Works

1. **Task Creation**: Tasks are created with ID, title, file, and prompt
2. **Task Start**: When a task is started, the system:

   - Updates the task status to "in-progress"
   - Extracts required capabilities from the task details
   - Finds the best agent for the task based on capabilities
   - Switches to that agent
   - Displays the assignment details

3. **Task Completion**: When a task is completed:
   - The task status is updated to "done"
   - The system switches back to the Executive Architect
   - The next pending task is shown

## Agent Capabilities

The system automatically matches tasks to agents based on these capabilities:

- **Frontend Developer**: UI, UX, React, CSS, JavaScript, components
- **Backend Developer**: API, server, database, security
- **Full-Stack Integrator**: Integration, deployment, fullstack
- **CMS Specialist**: CMS, content modeling, content management
- **Data Engineer**: Data modeling, analytics, visualization
- **Documentation Specialist**: Documentation, technical writing

## Usage

The agent delegation system is automatically initialized at startup through:

```json
"initialization": {
  "autoRunFiles": [
    ".cursor/centralized-init.js",
    ".cursor/enforcer.js",
    ".cursor/scripts/activate-memory-system.js",
    ".cursor/core/activate-memory-hooks.js",
    ".cursor/ensure-delegation.js"
  ]
}
```

### Task Commands

- **List tasks**: Display all tasks
- **Task status**: Show summary statistics
- **Start task**: Begin the next pending task (with automatic agent assignment)
- **Complete task**: Mark the current task as done (switches back to Executive Architect)
- **Current task**: Show details of the active task
- **Next task**: Show the next pending task
- **Task details [ID]**: Show details for a specific task
- **Create task**: Create a new task
- **Assign task [ID]**: Manually assign a task to the best agent

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests:

- `.cursor/test-delegation.js`: Tests the agent delegation system
- `.cursor/test-task-delegation.js`: Tests the integration between tasks and agents

To run the tests:

```
node .cursor/test-delegation.js
node .cursor/test-task-delegation.js
```

## Implementation Details

1. **Capability Extraction**: The system analyzes task file paths and prompts to extract capabilities
2. **Agent Matching**: The system finds the best agent based on matching capabilities
3. **Banner System**: When agents are switched, the banner system is updated to reflect the active agent
4. **Memory Integration**: The active agent is stored in memory for persistence

## Workflow Example

```
User: "start task"
System: "Starting task #001: Create frontend component"
       "Task assigned to ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Developer"
       "Capabilities: ui, ux, react, css"

... Frontend Developer works on the task ...

User: "complete task"
System: "Completed task #001: Create frontend component"
       "Next pending task: #002: Set up database schema"

... Executive Architect is now active again ...
```
